I made this with React originally and really didn't need to.

Current state: The site is broken and I don't really like the design anymore.  Live & learn, eh?

Next Steps: I'm going to rewrite this as a pretty basic html/css/js site.  Probably won't even need jQuery unless I want to take advantage of the animation pieces and even then, I may use greensock instead.
